### Hey! I'm Kenneth Ge ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning more about everything! Specifically how to come up with creative ideas. From what I can tell, the creative aspect is a huge part of what I want to explore in terms of research, algorithms, and practical solutions to real-world problems. 

ðŸ”¥ My interests are in desktop app development, AI (not necessarily confined to DL), networking, and more. I'm kind of all over the place, and I want to both stay broad and also see if any specialty areas catch my eye. Staying broad helps me be aware of broader tech trends, incorporate ideas across disciplines, and not be limited by my ability to engineer. On the other hand, CS is incredibly deep, and I'm also curious to see where/if I end up specializing.
