### Hey! I'm Kenny ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I'm an aspiring researcher/engineer/psychologist in the intersection of computer science and psychology. Whether that's AI, or prejudice, or programming languages, or HCI, I love thinking about how humans reason about problems, and how we unleash our creativity. I think as much as it can be important to solve hard problems, there's something so precious about being able to harness these things in the context of building healthier lives, unlocking our potential, and experiencing the richness and the fullness of the human experience. I think there's so much potential in improving the way we talk to and understand each other, and there's so much deep joy and fulfillment when we get to be our full authentic selves. 

ðŸ§ª Currently conducting research in ML, computer accessibility/HCI. Projects on back burner include: quantitatively analyzing men's body image issues. Topics I'd love to work on sometime: studying how stereotypes get embedded deep into our schemas of the world, prevalence of invalidation and betrayal trauma (particularly for people who are LGBT and/or seen as traditionally successful), food science broadly, neuroeconomics and neurophilosophy broadly, intersection of food and relationships (Please reach out if you'd be interested in conducting research into any of these topics together!)

ðŸ”¥ My technical experiences lies in backend web dev, accessible web design, desktop app development, AI/ML (not necessarily confined to DL), networking, game dev, and more.

Outside of CS, I compose music (on Spotify :D), and I also choreograph dance. Fun fact: at the end of high school, my friend Percy Baylis and I wrote a musical with an original plot and soundtrack!

Former captain of FTC team 11205 [@edgemontrobotics](https://github.com/edgemontrobotics), formerly taught coding [@ehsprogramming ](https://github.com/kenneth-ge/Edgemont-Programming-Club-Projects). 

P.S. (aka fun fact 2): I once noticed that math education in schools is often framed in an incredibly formulaic way, so I created a project called [Substitution Algbera](https://github.com/kenneth-ge/Substitution-Algebra) to test out a different, skills-based approach. It mimics algebra, but is structured in a way that allows learners to see that behind all the arbitrary variable manipulation is some kernel of intuition.
