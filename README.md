### Hey! I'm Kenny ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ“ Sophomore at CMU SCS, studying CS. Currently deciding between concentrating in systems, ML, or programming languages. Also minoring in psychology. Graduating in 2026

ðŸ”­ I love studying difficult problems, particularly in the intersection of computer science and psychology. I love thinking about how humans reason about problems, and how we express ourselves and relate to the world around us. I also enjoy hard optimization, and being able to design efficient and tight software in both an algorithmic and efficiency sense, as well as in a user-experience sense.  

ðŸ§ª Currently conducting research in ML and computer accessibility/HCI. Projects on back burner include: quantitatively analyzing men's body image issues. 

ðŸ”¥ My technical experiences lies in algorithms, backend web dev, systems and drivers, accessible web design, AI/ML (not necessarily confined to DL), desktop app development, networking, game dev, algorithms, and more.

Outside of CS, I compose music (on Spotify :D), and I also choreograph dance. Fun fact: at the end of high school, my friend Percy Baylis and I wrote a musical with an original plot and soundtrack!

Former captain of FTC team 11205 [@edgemontrobotics](https://github.com/edgemontrobotics), formerly taught coding [@ehsprogramming ](https://github.com/kenneth-ge/Edgemont-Programming-Club-Projects). 

P.S. (aka fun fact 2): I once noticed that math education in schools is often framed in an incredibly formulaic way, so I created a project called [Substitution Algbera](https://github.com/kenneth-ge/Substitution-Algebra) to test out a different, skills-based approach. It mimics algebra, but is structured in a way that allows learners to see that behind all the arbitrary variable manipulation is some kernel of intuition. Ever since I was little, I was always more fascinated by _how_ people came up with solutions to math problems, rather than what tricks the solutions themselves used. Eventually, I came to believe that everybody has the ability to be reached and to learn math, but most people have not been shown how.
