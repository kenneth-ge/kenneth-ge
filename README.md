### Hey! I'm Kenny ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ“ Junior at CMU SCS, studying CS, concentrating in programming languages. Also minoring in psychology. Graduating in 2026

ðŸ”­ I love studying difficult problems, particularly in the intersection of computer science and psychology. I love thinking about how humans reason about problems, and how we express ourselves and relate to the world around us. I also enjoy hard optimization, and being able to design efficient and tight software in both an algorithmic and efficiency sense, as well as in a user-experience sense.  

ðŸ§ª Currently conducting research in ML and computer accessibility/HCI

ðŸ”¥ My technical experiences lies in algorithms, backend web dev, systems and drivers, accessible web design, AI/ML (not necessarily confined to DL), desktop app development, networking, game dev, algorithms, and more.
