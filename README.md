### Hey! I'm Kenneth Ge ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning more about systems programming, network architecture design, and parallelized algorithms!

ðŸ”¥ My interests are computer networking, algorithms, and desktop app development

ðŸ¥… My ultimate goal is to solve both hard and soft engineering problems. In the past, I have loved both designing mathematically efficient and correct code (in my projects, robotics, olympiad, etc.), as well as working with small business to design web apps and improve their tech stack. I hope to combine all of these things in my future career, and am *currently* focused on becoming a better engineer and getting more hands-on experience solving hard engineering problems.
