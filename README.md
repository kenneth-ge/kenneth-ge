### Hey! I'm Kenny ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning more about everything!

ðŸ”¥ My interests are in desktop app development, AI (not necessarily confined to DL), networking, and more. I'm kind of all over the place, and I want to both stay broad and also see if any specialty areas catch my eye. Staying broad helps me be aware of broader trends, incorporate ideas across disciplines, and not be limited by my ability to engineer. On the other hand, CS is incredibly deep, and I'm also curious to see where/if I end up specializing. 

Outside of CS, I compose music (on Spotify :D), and I also choreograph dance. Fun fact: at the end of high school, my friend Percy Baylis and I wrote a musical with an original plot and soundtrack!

I pride myself on giving back to my communities, whether it's through offering mentorship, teaching coding, providing opportunities, or just plain being there to help out and listen in whatever way I can. Mostly recently, though, I've been super blessed to have a ton of loving and supportive people and communities to rely on.

P.S. (aka fun fact 2): I once realized that math problem solving ended up being super formulaic in the way that it's taught in schools, so I created a project called [Substitution Algbera](https://github.com/kenneth-ge/Substitution-Algebra) to invent a new system of math that resembles algebra but with letters and words instead of numbers and variables, and allows you to explore problem-solving techniques from the ground up.
