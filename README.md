### Hey! I'm Kenny ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning more about everything!

ðŸ”¥ My interests are in desktop app development, AI (not necessarily confined to DL), networking, and more. I'm currently focused on learning/exploring, and I want to work on something that has some broader positive impact on society. 

Outside of CS, I compose music (on Spotify :D), and I also choreograph dance. Fun fact: at the end of high school, my friend Percy Baylis and I wrote a musical with an original plot and soundtrack!

P.S. (aka fun fact 2): I once noticed that math education in schools is often framed in an incredibly formulaic way, so I created a project called [Substitution Algbera](https://github.com/kenneth-ge/Substitution-Algebra) to test out a different, skills-based approach. By mimicking algebra, but without all of the memorized formulas and complicated rules, you can explore problem-solving techniques from the ground up.
